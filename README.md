# Learn Code The Hard Way
Dumping exercises from the [Learn Code the Hard Way series.](https://learncodethehardway.org/) 

### Python
Here are the exercises from the [third edition of Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914), solved with Python 3.7.9 although it's an old book and uses Python 2.7. 
Also I skipped many exercises =) 

### More Python 
From the follow-up [Learn MORE Python](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-More-Python-Hard-Way/dp/0134123484/ref=pd_sbs_4/140-3364874-8093932?pd_rd_w=BTYep&pf_rd_p=2833aeda-81ca-4f9f-9f23-8e2fabbc8769&pf_rd_r=CE8EPBFTCNMN6YPQ8HP2&pd_rd_r=fb9fe622-603b-4024-a1a4-a00880dacc60&pd_rd_wg=Oa2hy&pd_rd_i=0134123484&psc=1), now with Python 3 from the book itself.
